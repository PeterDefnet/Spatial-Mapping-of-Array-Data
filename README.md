# Mapping Electrocatalyst Activity across >6000 Conditions Simultaneously


Here I described a data pipeline used in mh Ph.D. lab for mapping electrocatalyst activity from an array of  




#Here I quantify the interparticle spacing between thousands of nanoparticles randomly positioned on a substrate. The pipeline automates the characterization of novel electrode arrays made in my Ph.D. lab.
